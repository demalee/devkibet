                  <p> Viewers can easily decide whether to book ticket in advance or not by using this system. For doing this we have to develop a methodology in which the historical data of each component such as actor, actress, director, music that influences the success or failure of a movie is given is due to weight  and then based on multiple thresholds calculated on the basis of descriptive statistics of dataset of each component. Admin will add the film crew data. Admin will add movies data of a particular film crew. Admin will add new movie data along with film crew details as well as release date of the new movie. Based on the weight age of historical data of each film crew the movie will be labeled as success or failure.
